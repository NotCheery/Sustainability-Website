      <p class="paragraph-right">
        According to the EPA, Sustainability is the ability of humans and nature to exist in harmony without compromising the support for present and future generations.
      <br><br>
        The United Nations has 17 goals that are aimed to improve and contribute to a sustainable environment that aims to help nature and people. The goals include no poverty, no hunger, good health, quality education, gender equality, clean water, sustainable communities, and much more.

  <!--Impact-->
  <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p> 
      According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), humans have contributed to rapid changes to the atmosphere and ocean which increased disasters by a factor of 5 in 50 years that led to deaths of over 2 million people.

  <h4>Take a look at the infographic below by the UN Sustainable developmental goals.</h4>
    <p>
      According to the infographic, the rising rate of sea levels has doubled and temperatures are increasing. It is estimated that the world will exceed 1.5 Celcius by 2035.

  <h4>How can you help?</h4>
    <p>There are many ways to help the environment.</p>

      <ul class="list">
        <li>Recycle, Reduce, Reuse </li>
        <li>Transportation</li>
          <p>
            You can perhaps walk or use a bicycle if your destination is not too far. You can also make good use of public transportation if available.
          </p>
        <li>Make wise purchases, avoid fast fashion</li>
          <p>
            If possible, try spending your money on items that will last longer and that you can see yourself using often. Consider avoiding fast fashion as it may not last long and can result in contributing to more waste production.
          </p>
        <li>Volunteer</li>
          <p> 
            You can clean beaches and parks by collecting trash. You can grow plants. There's plenty you can do.
          </p>
      </ul>
